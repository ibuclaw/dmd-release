Add predefined version `D_Optimized` when compiling with `-O`

It allows code to distinguish whether it's being compiled with optimizations enabled (the `-O` flag was provided).
This is orthogonal to whether `-release` mode is active - for that see the
predefined versions `assert`, `D_NoBoundsChecks`, `D_Invariants`, etc.
